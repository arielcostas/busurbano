# Example: Adding a new stop using the 'new' parameter
# New stops are added directly in override files with new: true

# Example 1: New stop with basic information (commented out to avoid affecting production)
# 99001:
#   new: true
#   name: "New Development Stop"
#   location:
#     latitude: 42.229188
#     longitude: -8.722469
#   lines:
#     - "5"
#     - "12"
#   amenities:
#     - shelter

# Example 2: New stop with alert information
# 99002:
#   new: true
#   name: "Temporary Event Stop"
#   location:
#     latitude: 42.230000
#     longitude: -8.723000
#   lines:
#     - "EVENT"
#   title: "Special Event Stop"
#   message: "This stop is active during special events only."

# Note: The 'new: true' parameter tells the system to create a new stop.
# This parameter is automatically removed after the stop is added to the dataset.
# Choose stop IDs in the 90000+ range to avoid conflicts with existing stops.
